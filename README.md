This is a platformer where you play as a robot girl and try to reach the end of each level while trying to not be killed by enemies or other hazards.

There's the Dumb Enemy, a ball that rolls and will crush you if you're in its way. There's also the Leaping Enemy, who leaps really high and always lands where you just were. You should also keep an eye on spike pits, which kill anything that falls into them. Lastly, look out for the Steven Block, which kills you if you touch it. The Steven Block only shows up in Level 2.

There's also a tile called "uppinators" that inflicts antigravity to whatever is in the same space as it.

Along the way, you can collect oil. The oil doesn't really do anything but you can collect it. There are currently 30 oil cans in the game.

The game auto-saves every time a new level is loaded, so you can keep all your litres of oil and pick up at the start of the last level you played across sessions.

## Implementation
This game was made in Godot.

All the sprites were made by me using Piskel.

The font "5x5 pixel variant" was also made by me a few years ago with Fontstruct.

## References
Kind of inspired by a really old flash game "Wubzy's Amazing Adventure"

## Future Development
Make Leaping Enemy rideable (I already have a fix for this in mind but I have yet to implement it)

Tidy up Leaping Enemy math (there's a few kinks)

More levels, more tiles

Puzzles involving buttons and doors

Some mechanic to allow the player to manipulate the enemies in some way

A puzzle involving leading a Dumb Enemy or a Leaping Enemy to a button to open a door
